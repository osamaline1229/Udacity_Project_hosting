        <p>
          The people of Al Suwaiq organised a march of loyalty to His Majesty
          Sultan Haitham bin Tarik on Thursday. The procession marked the
          anniversary of His Majesty the Sultan assuming the reins of power in
          the country, which falls on January 11 of every year. The march
          organised by the wilayat’s equestrian committee saw more than 40
          riders on horseback, as citizens chanted national poetry and
          expressions of gratitude while children carried pictures of His
          Majesty and flags of the Sultanate of Oman. A number of officials,
          shaikhs, elders and residents of the Wilayat of Al Suwaiq participated
          in the march, which started from the Sultan Qaboos Mosque in Al Suwaiq
          to Al Suwaiq Fort

          escalation, achieving a ceasefire, opening corridors for the entry of
          aid, relief and humanitarian materials into the Gaza Strip, releasing
          the hostages, and setting the path towards the two-state solution. and

        <p>
          German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the European Union was
          concerned about rising tensions in the South China Sea, stressing the
          need to avoid another crisis in the world. Baerbock, the first German
          foreign minister to visit the Philippines in a decade, said preventing
          a crisis in the region was a priority for the EU. “I have just come
          from the Middle East, where the situation continues to be extremely
          dangerous, and the risk that one more spark could set the whole region
          ablaze still exists,” she said in a press conference after meeting her
          counterpart, Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo.

          AL JAZIRA STATE: Ten civilians were killed on Thursday by artillery
          fire in a residential area of Khartoum, the capital of war-torn Sudan,
          pro-democracy activists said. Sudan has been gripped by nearly nine
          months of war pitting army chief Abdel Fattah al Burhan against his
          former deputy, paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) commander
          Mohamed Hamdan Daglo. The conflict has claimed 12,000 lives, according
          to a conservative estimate by the ACLED analysis group, while the
          United Nations says more than seven million people have been
          displaced. In the latest bloodshed, the resistance committee of
          southern Khartoum said “10 civilians were killed by artillery fire in
          residential areas and the local market”. This committee is one of many
          groups that used to organise pro-democracy protests and now provide
          assistance during the war. Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have
          so far failed. In early January, Daglo toured several African
          capitals, marking his first foreign trip since the start of the
          conflict. In Addis Ababa, he signed a declaration with the former
          Sudan prime minister Abdalla Hamdok in what analysts say was a bid to
          position himself as a key interlocutor. Before the war, Burhan and
          Daglo had joined forces in October 2021 to oust Sudan’s civilian
          rulers, including Hamdok, ending two years of democratic transition.
          Unable to gain the upper hand in the war, neither side has been
          willing to make concessions at the negotiating table. The RSF appears
          to have been gaining new ground in recent months, however, with little
          resistance from the army. It now controls Khartoum and almost the
          entire vast western region of Darfur. It has also entered Al Jazira
          state, which hosts a significant portion of those displaced.
